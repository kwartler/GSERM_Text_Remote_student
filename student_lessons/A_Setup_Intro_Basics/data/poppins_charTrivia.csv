"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774065","Originally Walt Disney had considered Mary Martin, Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury for the part of Mary Poppins, based on the cold characterization portrayed in the P.L. Travers books. Walt Disney Pictures (with songwriters Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman and co-writer Don DaGradi acting as the studio's sort-of ""advance"" team) first considered Julie Andrews after seeing her on Ed Sullivan's The Ed Sullivan Show (1948) in January 1961 do excerpts from ""Camelot,"" the show she was appearing in on Broadway. About a month later Walt Disney himself went to New York, caught the show and sounded out Julie backstage after the show (the show was of double interest to Disney because his The Sword in the Stone (1963) animated feature was based on the first book of T.H. White's ""The Once and Future King."" ""Camelot"" was based on the fourth book of the same novel). It was at that February 1961 backstage meeting that Disney first sounded Andrews out, essentially acting out the entire script for her. At the time, her then-husband, Tony Walton, was there with them and Disney asked him about his occupation. He said that he was a costume and set designer. Disney invited Andrews to come to California and asked Walton to bring along his portfolio, so he too found a job with the production. While the film was offered to Andrews, she did not commit until the day after Warner Brothers announced that Audrey Hepburn would be doing My Fair Lady (1964) for them."

"/title/tt0058331/trivia/tr0774023","Walt Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights from P.L. Travers as early as 1938.

An urban myth is growing that it had something to do with Irish (or Scottish) prostitutes. Its use in the movie may have been inspired by a nonsense word the Sherman brothers (Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman) learned at summer camp. They remembered having a word that the adults didn't know, and thought the Banks children should have one, too."

She initially refused, citing the film as a reason why she would never again allow an adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins"" series. After several meetings, however, she relented, though when Mackintosh suggested using the songs from the Disney film in the production, Travers again balked. After much more pleading, Mackintosh convinced her to allow a stage production with the songs from the film on the strict proviso that no Americans participate in the development, and further that no one involved with the film version--including original film composers Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, both of whom were still alive and working at the time--could participate. Mackintosh proceeded with development of the stage adaptation for several years without any involvement from Disney, per Travers' wishes, though after the author's death in 1996 the Walt Disney Company was allowed some degree of creative involvement and went on to co-produce the musical with Mackintosh.
